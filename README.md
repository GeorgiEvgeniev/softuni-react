# Introduction to my project
My application is about cats. The main attraction is the catalog page which allows different users to add a cat to a catalog. Users can browse the cats, click for more details, and even delete their own added cat. Adding a cat requries the user to fill in some information about the cat such as name, age, breed and description. The home page displays the last 5 cats that were added to the catalog as well as some general information about cats. Register or login is required for users to be able to add cats.

## How to get started
* open the terminal and install the necessary dependencies `npm install`
* navigate to the frontend file and start the application `cd frontend` -> `npm start`
* open another terminal and navigate to the server, make sure the server is running `cd server` -> `node server.js`
